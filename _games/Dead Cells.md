<!-- Write your game description here. -->
Dead Cells is a rougelike game where you run through stages of the game obtaining weapons as you go, the game has cool stuff such as kicking and straight out greatswords, to simpler things such as shields that can reflect attacks, the game is difficult but very nice and addictive!

## My Rating

**Overall:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
The game gives a lot of amazing aspects but falls short to not being the most comfortable experience on the mobile, it is a whole lot better using a controller.
