<!-- Write your game description here. -->
Dredge is a game about fishing, I think, you fish a lot of things from fish, to fish, to scrap metals..? yeah it's weird but the game is addicting, very and puts you into a narrative story that is rather basic but interesting enough to do it, you need to obtain "artifacts" which are items in different areas that you can give to a mysterious man, what will he do with them? That's for you to discover.

## My Rating

**Overall:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ☆

The game is really cool but misses on some aspects as a proper narrative, although the gameplay is amazing and has great accessibility features, the game still misses on some parts to it.
